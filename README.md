```

```bash
cd RickDangerousUpdate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# Usage

The script is self-explanatory, it will guide you through the whole process, you make your choices by simple pressing numbers on your keyboard.
Just run the script inside a terminal like this:

```
python3 update.py 
```

# Attention

The script automatically creates a 'config.ini' which saves your SSH credentials.

The script will overwrite files on your retropie.

You will lose any changes you made to gamelist.xml or any other configuration file if they are included in any improvement archive.
